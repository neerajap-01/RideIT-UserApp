## Used By

Carpooling for Students is not implemented still, but our objective is to help students staying in same locality to travel together and save fuel as well as money and ensure complete safety to an individual. This application can also be used by teachers/ staff members. Carpooling usually means to divide the travel expenses equally between all the occupants of the vehicle (driver or passenger). The driver doesn't try to earn money, but to share with several people the cost of a trip he/she would do anyway.
